# labyrinth
labyrinth is a proof-of-concept for a modal desktop environment interface. it is the first of its kind, at least presented publicly, designed around the workflow of dwm. at this time, i am working on completing it for dwm, then moving to hyprland, sway, and i3. that being said, you can probably take what's here already and just move some things around using `sed` and the programs you actually want.
