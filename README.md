# labyrinth
labyrinth is a proof-of-concept for a modal desktop environment interface. it is the first of its kind, at least presented publicly, designed around the workflow of dwm. at this time, i am working on completing it for dwm, then moving to hyprland, sway, and i3. that being said, you can probably take what's here already and begin tinkering for it to adhere to your chosen DE/WM.  

pro-tip: use `sed`.
