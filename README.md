# labyrinth
labyrinth is a proof-of-concept for a modal desktop environment interface.   

pro-tip: use `sed` if you want to make similar but sweeping changes to files. otherwise, just wait for me to make her human-friendly. 

currently being in: `dwm`
will be tested in: `ratpoison`

after `ratpoison`:

`i3`
`sway`
`qtile`
`hyprland`
`xmonad`
`awesome`
`bspwm`
