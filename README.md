# labyrinth
labyrinth is a proof-of-concept for a modal desktop environment interface.   
will be coming to `hyprland`, `sway`, `i3`, `xmonad`, `qtile`, etc.
just need to finish emacs mode before i begin playing with other APIs or whatever you'd call them

pro-tip: use `sed`. otherwise, just wait for me to make her human-useable.
